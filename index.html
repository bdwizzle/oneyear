            <p>Happy one year anniversary bubby! Time goes by so fast I never thought I'd reach one year with someone. Thank you for everything you do and I sowee I annoy you sometimes :( I always gonna love you no matter what I promise, even if I nu communicate it well. This is just one of the many years to come. Also, I really hope you like this "website" that I created even though it may seem nerdy or corny I just thought it would be cute ;-; But anyways, I gonna adore you and annoy for the rest of my life and you gonna have to deal with it >:3 I cant wait for the future that we're gonna have. We're gonna have our own place, be successful, travel the world, have a bunch of bebes (kitties, doggos, bunnies, and actual bebes), and eat the best food. I never thought I'd actually put coding to use, but here I am coding a website just for you. And they say romance is dead. I can't wait for you to come in September ;-; we can do whatever we want and I get to baby you at night. I know we've been together for a long time already, a whole year to be specific, but I've been very hesitant about something. I really hope this doesn't affect us. So before you go to college, I really need to ask you something important, it's been a burning question I've had for months. I just wanted to ask...if you knew who the muffin man was. I hope I scared you LMAO. But I really wish we couldve done something together in person for this special event :( but its okay because we'll have plenty of opportunities in the future. As of right now while Im coding this my back is hurting, the things I do for you. Thanks Bruno, I found the girl I would throw a grenade at. JKJK I found the girl that I would catch a grenade for her :P Um I cant figure out how to open this on a phone, fuck. I really hope this will work otherwise ima be really mad. I dont even know how to get a link for this cause it just appears as a file in the search bar :/ worst case scenario I can just send you a picture of it but that wouldnt be as fun. But is okie because its the effort that counts. Wait I think I can just send you this file to your laptop. Wait nvm I dont think that works either welp. I guess i'll have to email it to you but it wont look as cool :/ I really wished this worked and could open in a browser :( I even tried creating a zip file and sending it to you but I tested it and only the HTML worked but not the CSS (basically all the coloring and styling) But enough of me complaining again. You really push myself to become the best version of myself, I always try my best to be the best boyfriend you could ever have. Sowee if I quiet sometimes or dont communicate much, thats just how I am :( thats how its been since the beginning. You always make me the happiest boi on earth and is gon be like that for the rest of our lives. You always gonna be the best girlfriend and my best buddy for life :3 my poop buddy my pee buddy my shower buddy my stinky buddy my workout buddy my gaming buddy my anime buddy my cuddle buddy and the list goes on. You'll always be my favorite person in the whole wide world. You mean the entire universe to me. I wouldnt want to be with anyone else. We 4 lyfers :) and we're gonna be kitties in love in the afterlife, the cutest kitties. Thank you for all you do, you always here to listen to me, always support me, always care for me, always look out for me, always check on me, and always lob me ;-; I'll promise to do the same for you for the rest of my life. I wish I couldve done more like give you flowers and make us dinner but is okie :( I can do that in the future. No matter how hard times get or how difficult and frustrated you may be, you can always turn to me for support and comfort. I know its been difficult lately but just know I'm always here no matter what. But, I lob you with all my heart bubby! I hope this will be an amazing day for us :) and that this day will mark the beginning of countless years that I get to spend with you. Happy one year again bubby!</p>
